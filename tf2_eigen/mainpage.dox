\b tf2_eigen contains functions for converting between geometry_msgs and Eigen data types.

This library is an implementation of the templated conversion interface specified in tf/convert.h.
It enables easy conversion from geometry_msgs Transform and Point types to the types specified
by the Eigen matrix algebra library (see http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).

See the <A HREF="http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions">Conversions overview</A>
wiki page for more information about datatype conversion in tf2.

\section codeapi Code API

This library consists of one header only, tf2_eigen/tf2_eigen.hpp, which consists mostly of
specializations of template functions defined in tf2/convert.h.
