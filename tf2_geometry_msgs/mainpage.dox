This library is an implementation of the templated conversion interface specified in tf/convert.h.
It offers conversion and transform convenience functions between various geometry_msgs data types,
such as Vector, Point, Pose, Transform, Quaternion, etc.

See the <A HREF="http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions">Conversions overview</A>
wiki page for more information about datatype conversion in tf2.
