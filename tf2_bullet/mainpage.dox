\b tf2_bullet contains functions for converting between geometry_msgs and Bullet data types.

This library is an implementation of the templated conversion interface specified in tf/convert.h.
It enables easy conversion from geometry_msgs Transform and Point types to the types specified
by the Bullet physics engine API (see http://bulletphysics.org).

See the <A HREF="http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions">Conversions overview</A>
wiki page for more information about datatype conversion in tf2.
